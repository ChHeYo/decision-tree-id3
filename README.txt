(A) No collaborator
(B) Need to run the program in the following order:

** Python 3**

>> python decision_tree.py
>> Please enter a file name: (enter file name)
>> (for example - iris.data.discrete.txt)

And you would get an output.

(C) The program would show how training data were split and what attributes were used to split examples.

** Important Note: the program always assumes that the last element in a row is the target. Therefore, it is imperative to put the target at the last position of a list.

** If there is any missing data, the program might throw an error. I made a primitive test that checks whether a row is missing data but ultimately, it would be more helpful to a tester to first see if there is any missing data. Might need to implement that feature in the future.
